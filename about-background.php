                        The Honourable Prime Minister of India, in his address at the 106th Indian Science Congress on 3rd January 2019, emphasised the need for establishing an expanded research ecosystem. There is a need to build a robust research ecosystem at all educational institutions in the State of Goa. It is considered necessary to encourage excellence in innovative research in the State of Goa and to provide state-of-the-art research facilities to researchers, faculty and students of Goa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) aims to bring significant educational changes in India and emphasises research and innovation at all educational levels. To bring the State of Goa to the forefront of research and innovation, the sub-committee entrusted to prepare a roadmap for implementing NEP 2020 in the State of Goa has recommended establishing Goa State Research Foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accordingly, the Goa State Research Foundation was established through the Goa State Research Foundation Act 2022 (Goa Act 8 of 2022) on 17th October 2022.
