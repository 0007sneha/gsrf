                            excellent way by which we can use our students to gather data and introduce our students to recent
                            trends in research and make them aware of different research areas. Also, DHE has provided us with
                            excellent resource people. We got numerous tips and made us aware of different trends in research. I

                            This very important initiative as research is much neglected at undergraduate level and sometimes at
                            postgraduate level. As teachers we also need to brush up on our research skills and get feedback
                            regularly on how to improve our research abilities. This will also help us to cater students better. It’s
                            good that the DHE has come up with such an initiative but also it would have been better to put into
                            practice not only research at the final year but inculcate the seeds of research and its methodology
                            from 1st year itself because by the time they are in final year they have an idea of the field in which
                            they want to work in order to bring change in society.',

                            especially when they begin college. A good opportunity with this FDP is to encourage teachers to
                            refine their skills or pick up new ones which will help them understand how research particularly
                            among undergraduate and graduates can be done in a much better way.',
